# Ketkar-Shao_2023
Code and data for the manuscript 'Multifaceted luminance gain control beyond photoreceptors in Drosophila'

The zipped folder 'code_all_Ketkar_Shao_2023' contains Matlab code for the analysis of two-photon calcium imaging and behavioral datasets, and also for modeling. In the modeling folder, the subfolder names indicate to which figure the respective code belongs.

Data quantifications are distributed over the following five zipped folders:
1. Behavior_total turning: turning responses of all genotypes, segregated by figures (and the experimental paradigm), calculated using the script 'calculate_total_turning.m'.
2. Two-photon calcium imaging_L2 (fig 1, 2, S1): quantification of L2 step responses when measured in adapting conditions.
3. Two-photon calcium imaging_L2_ND0.9 (fig S3): pre-processed data comprising L2 calcium traces in response to random luminance steps, with four different step durations (ND 0.9).
4. Two-photon calcium imaging_L2_ND1.5 (fif S3): pre-processed data comprising L2 calcium traces in response to random luminance steps, with four different step durations (ND 1.5).
5. Two-photon calcium imaging_L3 (fig 4): quantification of L3 step responses relative to the baseline measured over the dark epochs.
